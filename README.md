# CtkDocs
is an alternative Docs for CustomTkinter(https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) using Docsify. 

The current version is based on the contents available at https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/wiki created by Tom Schimansky.


#### Read the docs

If You only want to read the docs navigate to https://felipetesc.github.io/CtkDocs/#/.

#### Add new contents

If You desire to expand the documentation, clone this repo. To add new contents I'm using Obsidian client, but there are many other clients out there to the markdown language.

If You never used markdown read the the contents from https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/ and familiarize with it.
